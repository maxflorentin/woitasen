## Requirements

### Infrastructure with Terraform

Use Terraform to create a modular setup.
Implement remote state with S3 and DynamoDB for state locking.

### ECS and Load Balancing

Deploy a containerized web app (e.g., NGINX) on ECS Fargate.
Configure auto-scaling for the ECS tasks (min 1, max 3).
Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for traffic distribution.

### Networking and Security

Set up a VPC with public/private subnets across multiple AZs.
Use security groups to allow only HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the ALB.
Configure IAM roles for ECS tasks with least privilege permissions.

### Optional (Bonus): Monitoring and Alarms
Set up basic CloudWatch alarms for ECS (e.g., CPU and memory).
